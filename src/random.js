			"Consider, and you will find that almost all the transactions of the time of Vespasian differed little from those of the present day. You there find marrying and giving in marriage, educating children, sickness, death, war, joyous holidays, traffic, agriculture, flatterers, insolent pride, suspicions, laying of plots, longing for the death of others, newsmongers, lovers, misers, men canvassing for consulship — yet all these passed away, and are nowhere. \nM.

			//27
			"Let a man’s talents or virtues be what they may, we feel satisfaction in his society only as he is satisfied in himself. We cannot enjoy the good qualities of a friend if he seems to be none the better for them. \nHazlitt",
			//28
			"It was a false maxim of Domitian that he who would gain the people of Rome must promise all things and perform nothing. For when a man is known to be false in his word, instead of a column, which he might be by keeping it, for others to rest upon, he becomes a reed, which no man will vouchsafe to lean upon. Like a floating island, when we come next day to seek it, it is carried from the place we left it in, and, instead of earth to build upon, we find nothing but inconstant and deceiving waves. \nFeltham",

			"In the height of thy prosperity expect adversity, but fear it not. If it come not, thou art the more sweetly possessed of the happiness thou hast, and the more strongly confirmed. If it come, thou art the more gently dispossessed of the happiness thou hadst, and the more firmly prepared. \nQuarles",

			"Human experience, like the stern-lights of a ship at sea, illumines only the path which we have passed over. \nColeridge",

			"Man is an actor who plays various parts: ... First comes a boy, then out a lover starts; ... His garb is changed for, lo! a beggar’s rags; ... Then he’s a merchant with full money-bags; ... Anon, an aged sire, wrinkled and lean; ... At last Death drops the curtain on the scene. \nBhartrihari",

			//62
			"If thy garments be clean and thy heart be foul, thou needest no key to the door of hell. \nSa’dī",

			//72
			"The greatest men sometimes overshoot themselves, but then their very mistakes are so many lessons of instruction. \nTom Browne",
			//73
			"We may be as good as we please, if we please to be good. \nBarrow",
			//74
			"The round of a passionate man’s life is in contracting debts in his passion which his virtue obliges him to pay. He spends his time in outrage and acknowledgment, injury and reparation. \nJohnson",
			//75
			"To reprehend well is the most necessary and the hardest part of friendship. Who is it that does not sometimes merit a check, and yet how few will endure one? Yet wherein can a friend more unfold his love than in preventing dangers before their birth, or in bringing a man to safety who is travelling on the road to ruin? I grant there is a manner of reprehending which turns a benefit into an injury, and then it both strengthens error and wounds the giver. When thou chidest thy wandering friend do it secretly, in season, in love, not in the ear of a popular convention, for oftentimes the presence of a multitude makes a man take up an unjust defence, rather than fall into a just shame. \nFeltham",
			//76
			"I put no account on him who esteems himself just as the popular breath may chance to raise him. \nGoethe",
			//77
			"He who seeks wealth sacrifices his own pleasure, and, like him who carries burdens for others, bears the load of anxiety. \nHitopadesa",
			//78

			//79
			"The best preacher is the heart; the best teacher is time; the best book is the world; the best friend is God. \nTalmud",
			//80
			"A woman will not throw away a garland, though soiled, which her lover gave: not in the object lies a present’s worth, but in the love which it was meant to mark. \nBhāravi",
			//81
			"Men who have not observed discipline, and have not gained treasure in their youth, perish like old herons in a lake without fish. \nDhammapada",
			//82
			"As drops of bitter medicine, though minute, may have a salutary force, so words, though few and painful, uttered seasonably, may rouse the prostrate energies of those who meet misfortune with despondency. \nBhāravi",
			//83
			"There are three whose life is no life: he who lives at another’s table; he whose wife domineers over him; and he who suffers bodily affliction. \nTalmud",
			//84
			"Let thy words between two foes be such that if they were to become friends thou shouldst not be ashamed. \nSa’dī",
			//85
			"An indiscreet man is more hurtful than an ill-natured one; for as the latter will only attack his enemies, and those he wishes ill to, the other injures indifferently both his friends and foes. \nAddison",
			//86
			"A man of quick and active wit ... For drudgery is more unfit, ... Compared to those of duller parts, ... Than running nags are to draw carts. \nButler",
			//87
			"All affectation is the vain and ridiculous attempt of poverty to appear rich. \nLavater",
			//88
			"There never was, there never will be, a man who is always praised, or a man who is always blamed. \nDhammapada",
			//89
			"A good man’s intellect is piercing, yet inflicts no wound; his actions are deliberate, yet bold; his heart is warm, but never burns; his speech is eloquent, yet ever true. \nMāgha",
			//90
			"He who can feel ashamed will not readily do wrong. \nTalmud",
			//91
			"A stranger who is kind is a kinsman; an unkind kinsman is a stranger. \nHitopadesa",
			//92
			"The good to others kindness show, ... And from them no return exact; ... The best and greatest men, they know, ... Thus ever nobly love to act. \nMahābhārata",
			//93
			"Trees loaded with fruit are bent down; the clouds when charged with fresh rain hang down near the earth: even so good men are not uplifted through prosperity. Such is the natural character of the liberal. \nBhartrihari",
			//94
			"The man who neither gives in charity nor enjoys his wealth, which every day increases, breathes, indeed, like the bellows of a smith, but cannot be said to live. \nHitopadesa",
			//95
			"That energy which veils itself in mildness is most effective of its object. \nMāgha",
			//96
			"Our writings are like so many dishes, our readers, our guests, our books, like beauty—that which one admires another rejects; so we are approved as men’s fancies are inclined.... As apothecaries, we make new mixtures every day, pour out of one vessel into another; and as those old Romans robbed all cities of the world to set out their bad-cited Rome, we skim off the cream of other men’s wits, pick the choice flowers of their tilled gardens, to set out our own sterile plots. We weave the same web still, twist the same rope again and again; or, if it be a new invention, ’tis but some bauble or toy, which idle fellows write, for as idle fellows to read. \nBurton",
			//97
			"It is our follies that make our lives uncomfortable. Our errors of opinion, our cowardly fear of the world’s worthless censure, and our eagerness after unnecessary gold have hampered the way of virtue, and made it far more difficult than, in itself, it is. \nFeltham",
			//98
			"There is not half so much danger in the desperate sword of a known foe as in the smooth insinuations of a pretended friend. \nR. Chamberlain",
			//99
			"Nothing is so oppressive as a secret; it is difficult for ladies to keep it long, and I know even in this matter a good number of men who are women. \nLa Fontaine",
			//100
			"All kinds of beauty do not inspire love: there is a kind of it which pleases only the sight, but does not captivate the affections. \nCervantes",
			//
			//101
			"Contentment consisteth not in heaping more fuel, but in taking away some fire. \nFuller",
			//102
			"It is difficult to personate and act a part long, for where truth is not at the bottom Nature will always be endeavouring to return, and will peep out and betray herself one time or other. \nTillotson",
			//103
			"The truest characters of ignorance ... Are vanity, pride, and arrogance; ... As blind men use to bear their noses higher ... Than those that have their eyes and sight entire. \nButler",
			//104
			"It is better to be well deserving without praise than to live by the air of undeserved commendation. \nR. Chamberlain",
			//105
			"He travels safe and not unpleasantly who is guarded by poverty and guided by love. \nSir P. Sidney",
			//106
			"Never put thyself in the way of temptation: even David could not resist it. \nTalmud",
			//107
			"Pride is a vice which pride itself inclines every man to find in others and overlook in himself. \nJohnson",
			//108
			"By six qualities may a fool be known: anger, without cause; speech, without profit; change, without motive; inquiry, without an object; trust in a stranger; and incapacity to discriminate between friend and foe. \nArabic",
			//109
			"Men are not to be judged by their looks, habits, and appearances, but by the character of their lives and conversations. ’Tis better that a man’s own works than another man’s words should praise him. \nSir R. L’Estrange",
			//110
			"To exert his power in doing good is man’s most glorious task. \nSophocles",
			//111
			"Those who are skilled in archery bend their bow only when they are prepared to use it; when they do not require it they allow it to remain unbent, for otherwise it would be unserviceable when the time for using it arrived. So it is with man. If he were to devote himself unceasingly to a dull round of business, without breaking the monotony by cheerful amusements, he would fall imperceptibly into idiotcy, or be struck with paralysis. \nHerodotus",
			//112
			"Blinded by self-conceit and knowing nothing, ... Like elephant infatuate with passion, ... I thought within myself, I all things knew; ... But when by slow degrees I somewhat learnt ... By aid of wise preceptors, my conceit, ... Like some disease, passed off; and now I live ... In the plain sense of what a fool I am. \nBhartrihari",
			//113
			"Time is the most important thing in human life, for what is pleasure after the departure of time? and the most consolatory, since pain, when pain has passed, is nothing. Time is the wheel-track in which we roll on towards eternity, conducting us to the Incomprehensible. In its progress there is a ripening power, and it ripens us the more, and the more powerfully, when we duly estimate it. Listen to its voice, do not waste it, but regard it as the highest finite good, in which all finite things are resolved. \nVon Humboldt",
			//114
			"All that we are is made up of our thoughts; it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speak or act with a pure thought, happiness will follow him, like a shadow that never leaves him. \nDhammapada",
			//115
			"Depend not on another, rather lean Upon thyself; trust to thine own exertions: Subjection to another’s will gives pain; True happiness consists in self-reliance. \nManu",
			//116
			"If the friendship of the good be interrupted, their minds admit of no long change; as when the stalks of a lotus are broken the filaments within them are more visibly cemented. \nHitopadesa",
			//117
			"Anger that has no limit causes terror, and unseasonable kindness does away with respect. Be not so severe as to cause disgust, nor so lenient as to make people presume. \nSa’dī",
			//118
			"Be patient, if thou wouldst thy ends accomplish; for like patience is there no appliance effective of success, producing certainly abundant fruit of actions, never damped by failure, conquering all impediments. \nBhāravi",
			//119
			"As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion breaks through an unreflecting mind. \nDhammapada",
			//120
			"Most men, even the most accomplished, are of limited faculties; every one sets a value on certain qualities in himself and others: these alone he is willing to favour, these alone will he have cultivated. \nGoethe",
			//121
			"Poverty, we may say, surrounds a man with ready-made barriers, which if they do mournfully gall and hamper, do at least prescribe for him, and force on him, a sort of course and goal; a safe and beaten, though a circuitous, course. A great part of his guidance is secure against fatal error, is withdrawn from his control. The rich, again, has his whole life to guide, without goal or barrier, save of his own choosing, and, tempted, is too likely to guide it ill. \nCarlyle",
			//122
			"By Fate full many a heart has been undone, And many a sprightly rose made woe-begone; Plume thee not on thy lusty youth and strength: Full many a bud is blasted ere its bloom. \nOmar Khayyām",
			//123
			"The best thing is to be respected, the next, is to be loved; it is bad to be hated, but still worse to be despised. \nChinese",
			//124
			"To be envied is a nobler fate than to be pitied. \nPindar",
			//125
			"He only does not live in vain ... Who all the means within his reach ...  Employs—his wealth, his thought, his speech— ... T’advance the weal of other men. \nSanskrit",
			//126
			"If you injure a harmless person, the evil will fall back upon you, like light dust thrown up against the wind. \nBuddhist",
			//127
			"In the life of every man there are sudden transitions of feeling, which seem almost miraculous. At once, as if some magician had touched the heavens and the earth, the dark clouds melt into the air, the wind falls, and serenity succeeds the storm. The causes which produce these changes may have been long at work within us, but the changes themselves are instantaneous, and apparently without sufficient cause. \nLongfellow",
			//128
			"Man is an intellectual animal, therefore an everlasting contradiction to himself. His senses centre in himself, his ideas reach to the ends of the universe; so that he is torn in pieces between the two without the possibility of its ever being otherwise. A mere physical being or a pure spirit can alone be satisfied with itself. \nHazlitt",
			//129
			"The pure in heart, who fear to sin, The good, kindly in word and deed — These are the beings in the world Whose nature should be called divine. \nBuddhist",
			//130
			"If thou desirest that the pure in heart should praise thee, lay aside anger; be not a man of many words; and parade not thy virtues in the face of others. \nFirdausī",
			//131
			"A wise man takes a step at a time; he establishes one foot before he takes up the other: an old place should not be forsaken recklessly. \nSanskrit",
			//132
			"The fish dwell in the depths of the waters, and the eagles in the sides of heaven; the one, though high, may be reached with the arrow, and the other, though deep, with the hook; but the heart of man at a foot’s distance cannot be known. \nBurmese",
			//133
			"The life of man is the incessant walk of nature, wherein every moment is a step towards death. Even our growing to perfection is a progress to decay. Every thought we have is a sand running out of the glass of life. \nFeltham",
			//134
			"I have observed that as long as a man lives and exerts himself he can always find food and raiment, though, it may be, not of the choicest description. \nGoethe",
			//135
			"There are no riches like the sweetness of content, nor poverty comparable to the want of patience. \nR. Chamberlain",
			//136
			"’Tis not for gain, for fame, from fear ... That righteous men injustice shun, ... And virtuous men hold virtue dear: ... An inward voice they seem to hear, ...  Which tells them duty must be done. \nMahābhārata",
			//137
			"As far and wide the vernal breeze ... Sweet odours waft from blooming trees, ... So, too, the grateful savour spreads ... To distant lands of virtuous deeds. \nSanskrit",
			//138
			"In this world, however little happiness may have been our portion, yet have we no desire to die. Whether he can speak of life as cheerful and delicate, or as full of pain, anxiety, and sorrow, never yet have I seen one who wished to die. \nFirdausī",
			//139
			"When morning silvers the dark firmament, ... Why shrills the bird of dawning his lament? ... It is to show in dawn’s bright looking-glass ... How of thy careless life a night is spent. \nOmar Khayyām",
			//140
			"Be thou generous, and gentle, and forgiving; as God hath scattered upon thee, scatter thou upon others. \nSa’dī",
			//141
			"In the body restraint is good; good is restraint in speech; in thought restraint is good: good is restraint in all things. \nDhammapada",
			//142
			"Men say that everyone is naturally a lover of himself, and that it is right that it should be so. This is a mistake; for in fact the cause of all the blunders committed by man arises from this excessive self-love. For the lover is blinded by the object loved, so that he passes a wrong judgment upon what is just, good, and beautiful, thinking that he ought always to honour what belongs to himself, in preference to truth. For he who intends to be a great man ought to love neither himself nor his own things, but only what is just, whether it happens to be done by himself or by another. \nPlato",
			//143
			"A man eminent in learning has not even a little virtue if he fears to practise it. What precious things can be shown to a blind man when he holds a lamp in his hand? \nHitopadesa",
			//144
			"The first forty years of our life give the text, the next thirty furnish the commentary upon it, which enables us rightly to understand the true meaning and connection of the text with its moral and its beauties. \nSchopenhauer",
			//145
			"Good actions lead to success, as good medicines to a cure: a healthy man is joyful, and a diligent man attains learning; a just man gains the reward of his virtue. \nHitopadesa",
			//146
			"Purpose without power is mere weakness and deception; and power without purpose is mere fatuity. \nSa’dī",

			"Riches disclose in a man’s character the bad qualities formerly concealed in his poverty. \nArabic",
			//149
			"Whate’er the work a man performs, The most effective aid to its completion— The most prolific source of true success— Is energy, without despondency. \nRamāyāna",
			//150
			"Humility is a virtue all preach, none practise, and yet everybody is content to hear. The master thinks it good doctrine for his servant, the laity for the clergy, and the clergy for the laity. \nSelden",
			//151
			"Authority intoxicates, ... And makes mere sots of magistrates; ... The fumes of it invade the brain, ... And make men giddy, proud, and vain; ... By this the fool commands the wise, ... The noble with the base complies, ... The sot assumes the rule of wit, ... And cowards make the base submit. \nButler",
			//152
			"No man learns to know his inmost nature by introspection, for he rates himself sometimes too low, and often too high, by his own measurement. Man knows himself only by comparing himself with other men; it is life that touches his genuine worth. \nGoethe",
			//153
			"Increase in goodness as long as thou art here, that, when thou departest, in that thou mayest still be joyful. According to our words and deeds in this life will be the remembrance of us in the world. \nFirdausī",
			//154
			"Parents’ affection is best shown by their teaching their children industry and self-denial. \nBurmese",

			// "A foolish husband fears his wife; a prudent wife obeys her husband. \nChinese",
			//162
			"He who devises evil for another falls at last into his own pit, and the most cunning finds himself caught by what he had prepared for another. But virtue without guile, erect like the lofty palm, rises with greater vigour when it is oppressed. \nMetastasio",
			//163
			"Laughing is peculiar to man, but all men do not laugh for the same reason. There is the attic salt which springs from the charm in the words, from the flash of wit, from the spirited and brilliant sally. There is the low joke which arises from scurrility and idle conceit. \nGoldoni",
			//164
			"The woman who is resolved to be respected can make herself be so even amidst an army of soldiers. \nCervantes",
			//165

			"Use law and physic only for necessity. They that use them otherwise abuse themselves into weak bodies and light purses. They are good remedies, bad businesses, and worse recreations. \nQuarles",
			//168
			"In some dispositions there is such an envious kind of pride that they cannot endure that any but themselves should be set forth as excellent; so that when they hear one justly praised they will either openly detract from his virtues; or, if those virtues be, like a clear and shining light, eminent and distinguished, so that he cannot be safely traduced by the tongue, they will then raise a suspicion against him by a mysterious silence, as if there were something remaining to be told which overclouded even his brightest glory. \nFeltham",
			//169
			"Every man thinks with himself, I am well, I am wise, and laughs at others; and ’tis a general fault amongst them all, that which our forefathers approved—diet, apparel, humours, customs, manners — we deride and reject in our time as absurd. \nBurton",
			//170

			"It is a proverbial expression that every man is the maker of his own fortune, and we usually regard it as implying that every man by his folly or wisdom prepares good or evil for himself. But we may view it in another light, namely, that we may so accommodate ourselves to the dispositions of Providence as to be happy in our lot, whatever may be its privations. \nVon Humboldt",
			//174
			"Be very circumspect in the choice of thy company. In the society of thy equals thou shalt enjoy more pleasure; in the society of thy superiors thou shalt find more profit. To be the best of the company is the way to grow worse; the best means to grow better is to be the worst there. \nQuarles",

			//178
			"Man, though he be gray-headed when he comes back, soon gets a young wife. But a woman’s time is short within which she can expect to obtain a husband. If she allows it to slip away, no one cares to marry her. She sits at home, speculating on the probability of her marriage. \nAristophanes",
			//179

			"Man is the only animal with the powers of laughter, a privilege which was not bestowed on him for nothing. Let us then laugh while we may, no matter how broad the laugh may be, and despite of what the poet says about 'the loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind.' The mind should occasionally be vacant, as the land should sometimes lie fallow, and for precisely the same reason. \nEgerton Smith",
			//187
			"The man of affluence is not in fact more happy than the possessor of a bare competency, unless, in addition to his wealth, the end of his life be fortunate. We often see misery dwelling in the midst of splendour, whilst real happiness is found in humbler stations. \nHerodotus",
			//188
			"Love of money is the disease which renders us most pitiful and grovelling, and love of pleasure is that which renders us most despicable. \nLonginus",
			//189
			"He who labours diligently need never despair. We can accomplish every thing by diligence and labour. \nMenander",
			//190
			"Lost money is bewailed with deeper sighs Than friends, or kindred, and with louder cries. \nJuvenal",
			//191
			"In one short verse I here express ... The sum of tomes of sacred lore: ... Beneficence is righteousness, ... Oppression’s sin’s malignant core. \nSanskrit",
			//192
			"A wound inflicted by arrows heals, a wood cut down by an axe grows, but harsh words are hateful—a wound inflicted by them does not heal. Arrows of different sorts can be extracted from the body, but a word-dart cannot be drawn out, for it is seated in the heart. \nMahābhārata",
			//193
			"To address a judicious remark to a thoughtless man is a mere threshing of chaff. \nHitopadesa",

			//195
			"Certain books seem to be written, not that we might learn from them, but in order that we might see how much the author knows. \nGoethe",
			//196
			"All that is old is not therefore necessarily excellent; all that is new is not despicable on that account alone. Let what is really meritorious be pronounced so by the candid judge after due investigation; blockheads alone are influenced by the opinion of others. \nHindu Drama",
			//197
			"One of the diseases of this age is the multitude of books. It is a thriftless and a thankless occupation, this writing of books: a man were better to sing in a cobbler’s shop, for his pay is a penny a patch; but a book-writer, if he get sometimes a few commendations from the judicious, he shall be sure to reap a thousand reproaches from the malicious. \nBarnaby Rich",
			//198
			"We rather confess our moral errors, faults, and crimes than our ignorance. \nGoethe",
			//199
			"The angel grows up in divine knowledge, the brute, in savage ignorance, and the son of man stands hesitating between the two. \nPersian",
			//200
			"She is a wife who is notable in her house; she is a wife who beareth children; she is a wife whose husband is as her life; she is a wife who is obedient to her lord. The wife is half the man; a wife is man’s dearest friend; a wife is the source of his religion, his worldly profit, and his love. He who hath a wife maketh offerings in his house. Those who have wives are blest with good fortune. Wives are friends, who, by their kind and gentle speech, soothe you in your retirement. In your distresses they are as mothers, and they are refreshment to those who are travellers in the rugged paths of life. \nMahābhārata",
